       <p>One useful SEO technique is the use of keyword optimization. By using any relevant keywords into website content, descriptions, and headers, websites end up ranking them higher in search engine results, which makes it easier for users to find them. Google Keyword Planner can help target the most searched phrases which will help to improve visibility and traffic (Patel, 2019). A second useful SEO approach is improving the speed of the website and its performance. With Google prioritizing fast loading websites since they provide a better overall user experience, optimizing image sizes, enabling browser caching, and reducing the usage of JavaScript will help to achieve better results (Dean, 2020). Obtaining backlinks from reputable websites is important for establishing credibility. Backlinks inform the search engines that a site is trustworthy, which helps to raise its ranking on search results (Fishkin, 2021).</p>


<p>Using meta descriptions is another effective SEO strategy. This method focuses on creating clear and easy to understand summaries for web pages. The descriptions displayed below the page title in search results are used to provide users with a quick overview of the content and can increase engagement. By including relevant keywords in meta descriptions, businesses can better align with user search intent and improve their rankings (Patel, 2019). Making unique descriptions for each web page allows for users and search engines to receive accurate information in order to attain a higher visibility and receive better engagement (Dean, 2020). A simple technique such as this one helps websites stand out in search results and attract more visitors.</p>

<p>Optimizing a website for mobile devices is another important SEO practice. With people using mobile phones for convenient viewing, it is necessary to make sure that pages are mobile friendly and responsive. Google prioritizes mobile friendly websites in its rankings, meaning businesses that optimize for mobile are likely to see better performance on search engine results pages (Patel, 2019). Responsive design, fast loading times, and simplified navigation are key aspects of mobile optimization that enhance the user experience and help retain visitors (Dean, 2020). This approach not only meets user expectations but also aligns with search engine algorithms.</p>


<p>Social Media Optimization (SMO) is important for digital marketing, with the integration of social media buttons on websites enhancing their benefits. Allowing users to easily share website content with their networks using a button increases the exposure and drives traffic from that social media site, to bring exposure to the brand’s visibility. This connection between social media and the website increases the brand’s reach and visibility. Businesses can benefit from increased exposure as users share content with their networks, which in turn allows for more engagement and traffic growth.</p>

<p>Embedding Instagram feeds on a website showcases a brand’s visual identity and engages users directly. The website visitors become Instagram followers and vice versa, strengthening the social media presence.  This integration also keeps the website visually appealing and up-to-date with fresh content, which helps maintain user interest and promotes cross-platform growth. Using instagram allows for users to take a look at exactly what you offer and how others feel about the services you offer as well.</p>

<p>Using Twitter’s Share button encourages real time discussions about website content. businesses can increase engagement to help increase their online reach (Zarella, 2017). By allowing users to share content directly from the website to their Twitter profiles, this SMO feature helps generate conversations around the brand. The quick nature of Twitter makes it ideal for spreading updates, promotions, or blog posts, helping businesses increase visibility and interact with a larger audience. This strategy not only drives traffic but also creates opportunities for meaningful engagement.</p>
