    <h3>Courses</h3>
    <p>ITM780 is a course focused on the fundamentals of web design along with learning CSS and Javascript. A course that I feel has been most useful to me has been ITM415 as it was the course that I feel made me understand and potentially see as a possible interest for me when looking for jobs.</p>
